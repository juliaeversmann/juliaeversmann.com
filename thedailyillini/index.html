          <p>
            the daily illini is the independent student newspaper at the
            university of illinois (since 1871!) i worked here for three years:
            i started as a designer, and worked my way up to managing editor for
            visuals. i created a visual identity for "best of cu", wrote and
            designed a style guide for staff, and of course: designed pages and
            covers for the weekly print paper.
          </p>

        <div class="project-paragraph">
          <h4>weekly newspaper</h4>
          <p>
            every sunday, all of the editors would get together and work on the
            weekly print edition. i spent the day designing pages, editing
            photos, and copyediting stories. it was high-pressure, but i learned
            a lot from managing a team and working with such quick deadlines.
            you can view the papers i led the design of
            <a href="https://issuu.com/thedailyillini">here</a>, from 3/22/22,
            to 3/8/23.

          <h4>best of cu</h4>
          <p>
            every year, the daily illini surveys the community and creates an
            issue covering the best spots in town and on campus. i was tasked
            with creating the brand identity for this edition. i used a
            monochromatic color scheme to align with the buzz's visual identity,
            and utilized our existing type system to create a brand that looked
            more modern and sleek than our typical weekly papers. i created
            designs for social media, stickers, and created a special edition
            template for our designers to work with on indesign.

          <h4>style guide</h4>
          <p>
            before i left my position, i knew i wanted to create a guide to all
            things di. i wrote and design a book detailing everything i could to
            assist future staff. the brand has changed a lot over the years, and
            i know there's strength in consistency. the style guide covers the
            essentials of maintaining our brand, typography, and basic graphic
            design principles. i especially emphasized readability as a priority
            for our audience.

          <p>
            i had the opportunity to design two newsboxes. this newsbox features
            all of our previous mastheads, collaged together and recolored to
            resemble newsprint. here's a photo of me standing next to the
            finished product on green street!
