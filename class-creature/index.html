          <h4>overview</h4>
          <p>
            we are currently seeing the impacts on socialization in our schools
            due to increased technology usage, especially following the covid-19
            pandemic. students are struggling to connect with each other, their
            teachers, and lack the confidence to ask for help when they need it.
            with technology and artificial intelligence becoming more and more
            integrated into school curriculums, we need to find an effective
            response to this problem before they become even more separated from
            each other.

          <h4>initial research</h4>
          <p>
            i explored already existing education apps that inspire
            collaboration, such as kahoot and peardeck, to see what aspects were
            already encouraging socialization, and what could be improved. while
            these apps were fun to use, they both required additional work for
            teachers to add their own content.
            <br /><br />
            i also explored successful teaching methods post-covid, specifically
            project based learning (pbl) and gamification. both of these methods
            have been gaining popularity as they allow students to work together
            in groups and feel more connected to their coursework.
            <br /><br />
            after my initial research, i landed on my final research question:
            how can we maintain socialization and development within highschool
            students if we continue to integrate technology and ai into daily
            education practices?

        <div class="project-paragraph">
          <h4>user research</h4>
          <p>
            to answer this question, i conducted user research. i reached out to
            current high school teachers and students, and received very similar
            responses from both groups.
            <br /><br />
            overall, attention spans are getting shorter and shorter. students
            are drawn to their phones or laptops during class, and often find
            themselves getting distracted. however, teachers do appreciate the
            useful aspects of tech, such as making some aspects of collaborating
            easier.
            <br /><br />
            group discussions and activities get the most engagement in the
            classroom, but require planning and organization beforehand from
            teachers, which isn't always realistic for them to do often. covid
            impacted educators just as much as it did students, so it isn't
            realistic to expect additional work on their end.

          <h4>potential solutions</h4>
          <p>
            in brainstorming potential solutions, i experimented with adobe
            firefly to quickly visualize my ideas and bring them to life. with
            my research showing me that group work is most effective in allowing
            students to socialize, and trying to make this experience as easy as
            possible to implement in today's classrooms, i explored 3 possible
            directions: a fidget toy stationed at each student's desk that would
            track stress levels and notify teachers when breaks or group
            collaboration was necessary, a gamified lesson plan that would use
            ai to transform teacher's lessons into a game for students to play
            and learn from, and a virtual pet that would interact with the
            students and allow them to learn about and connect with each other.
          </p>

        <div class="project-paragraph">
          <h4>final direction</h4>
          <p>
            i ended up creating a class virtual pet. with this direction,
            students can all have something to bond over, a beginning point of
            collaboration. fittingly, the experience is named "class creature."
            the class pet, a frog, is simple and cute, allowing it to adapt to
            any medium it needs to.
            <br /><br />
            originally, i was going to include coursework very specifically in
            this experience, with the pet possibly being involved in quizzes,
            lessons, and more. however, as i began formulating this plan, i
            realized that students needed something completely separate from
            work to fully focus on individual healing and building confidence.
            by separating this experience from academics, students are allowed
            to have a purely fun, non-stressful experience, meaning
            socialization isn't dependent on their success in the classroom. the
            goal is for this tool to focus on building confidence and
            socialization outside of classwork, so that students can then bring
            these newfound social skills with them when encountering more
            intimidating aspects of the class.

          <h4>logo and style guide</h4>
          <p>
            the final logo is two c's, an abbreviation of class creature, in the
            shape of lily pads to connect with the pet frog. the type pairing is
            clean and friendly, aiming to be accessible and easy to read for
            students, and inviting to interact with. the color palette also
            builds off of warmth and friendliness, with warm oranges used to
            contrast with the green of the frog.

          <h4>deliverables</h4>
          <p>
            final deliverables include a selection of screens that a class could
            potentially interact with, cards that would bring a physical element
            into the classroom and allow students to connect with the virtual
            pet, and a fidget toy.
            <br /><br />
            the application would be projected on a virtual whiteboard in the
            classroom, allowing the entire class to participate together. each
            student would get their own deck of cards, each with their own
            opportunity to engage with the virtual pet. these cards would be
            scanned, and would be included in the virtual pet's world. this
            allows for the personalization of the experience; the pet will be
            able to directly relate with students' interests, as well as using
            their ideas for accessories to be added to the world. the fidget toy
            is another element to allow students to get excess energy out of
            their systems, and to feel more connected to the virtual pet.

          <h4>reflection</h4>
          <p>
            i have never had the opportunity to research a project in so much
            depth before beginning to design, and it provided me with such
            invaluable perspectives that deeply influenced the final product. i
            ended with a design proposal that i am genuinely passionate about,
            and that i think would actually foster positivity and connection
            within the classroom. socialization has been a struggle for students
            and teachers in the past few years, and they deserve an experience
            that will build their confidence and allow them to grow.
