          <p>
            created as a project in my typographic practice course, pocket
            bringhurst is a rulebook to typography, written and typeset by me.
            the entire semester was dedicated to understanding type through the
            lens of a book designer as it lays a foundation for typography in
            all other fields of design. pocket bringhurst contains my analyses
            of chapters from the elements of typographic style; it serves as a
            guide for designers to improve the readability of their type. you
            can view the complete book

          <h4>proofs</h4>
          <p>
            throughout the course, we completed typesetting exercises based on
            the bringhurst chapters we were reading. in the process, i became
            extremely confident in my printing skills. our instructors were very
            clear that in order to fully understand what is and isn't working
            about your design, you must view it in the medium it is meant for.
            in our case, this meant we could only properly critique and improve
            our work by looking at printed. i really appreciate their emphasis
            on practicing this, as it truly provides a different, necessary
            perspective on your design. i have continued this practice in future
            work, and have felt much more confident in the design process by
            doing so.

          <h4>reflection</h4>
          <p>
            typesetting this book completely changed my outlook on type, and
            gave me the tools i needed to understand it on a deeper level.
            understanding how to make my work as readable as possible is an
            invaluable lesson that i have carried with me. accessibility is my
            priority in everything i make.
