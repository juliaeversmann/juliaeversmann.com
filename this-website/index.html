          <h4>overview</h4>
          <p>
            it was essential that my portfolio conveyed my personality at every
            point of the experience. i started with three words that describe me
            to build my brand's identity upon: vibrant, weird, and playful.
            <br /><br />
            i also knew from the get go that i wanted to code the site from
            scratch. i love a good challenge, i learned a ton in the process,
            and there are absolutely no limits to what i can do with my site.
          </p>

          <h4>logo creation</h4>
          <p>
            through exploring other work and taking inspiration, i realized i've
            always been drawn to animal logos. nothing else would represent me
            properly. i love reptiles and insects, and with the right style, i
            knew the logo would also express my weirdness. you can see
            variations in my sketches, but i ultimately decided on a simple
            lizard with very wide eyes as the logo.
            <br /><br />
            this isn't your everyday lizard. he's unique, he's got that special
            something. yes, you've got it! this is a "lizard puppy." being the
            first and only of its species to exist, he will live out his eternal
            lifespan on my site. make sure you click on the lizard puppy to pet
            it.

          <h4>brand identity</h4>
          <p>
            my favorite color is rainbow (yes, that's a valid choice) and the
            color palette reflects that. the background color is a bright
            mustard yellow, making the overall tone warm and inviting. the
            foreground colors bring in the other colors of the rainbow, at
            shades that i felt were bright enough to reflect my energy while
            still being accessible.
            <br /><br />
            the display type, ruddy, is used for the wordmark only, as it is
            more readable at larger sizes. the other display and body text on
            the site is elza narrow, a low contrast font great for web that
            still feels connected to the wordmark through its letterforms and
            narrowness.

        <div class="project-paragraph">
          <h4>layout</h4>
          <p>
            i prototyped many different layouts to see what would best present
            my work. with such a strong brand personality, it was essential that
            my work was easy to navigate and had its own space to shine. i
            decided against over designed pages so that there is no distraction
            from the content itself; the layout is simple and clean.
            <br /><br />
            this site needed to be playful,
            <span id="turbulence">kinetic</span>, bringing my work to life.
            using an svg filter, certain elements on every page are textured and
            moving, bringing a stronger sense of energy than still graphics
            could achieve. this is especially effective in bringing my logo to
            life, as it is an actual creature.

          <h4>coding</h4>
          <p>
            i was familiar with html and css before coding this site, but i
            learned so much more about proper architecture and organization
            because i was doing it all from scratch. i worked with my partner
            <a href="https://mnovelli.com/" target="blank">matt novelli</a> to
            bridge the gap on more unfamiliar concepts, like javascript and root
            styles, but the majority of the site was done by myself. i found
            myself absolutely loving the process, and i'm itching to experiment
            with css whenever i get the chance. <br /><br />
            i consistently checked the accessibility of the site using color
            contrast checkers and pagespeed sites, making adjustments as
            necessary.
            <br /><br />
            the site is hosted on github, you explore the code
            <a

            learning curve!

            my portfolio is a neverending project, and i work on it very often.
            i'm currently working on adding more portfolio projects, improving
            accessibility, and implementing more elements of my visual identity.
